# Note
Nekomata is discontinued as I decided to add Kitsu and AniList support to MAL Library. This Repo will remain as an archive for Nekomata.

Here is the timeline:
* Kitsu and AniList Support - Mid 2018, Beta in Early May 2018

You can follow the development of MAL Library [over here](https://github.com/Atelier-Shiori/MAL-Library)
